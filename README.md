# Economic Impact of Entrepreneurial Alumni: A Case Study of University of Virginia

http://web3.darden.virginia.edu/uva-alumni/  

I designed this website to share -- through interactive visualization done with d3.js -- the findings of a large survey among U.Va. alumni. I was also the analyst of the survey data and one of the co-authors of the narrative report (http://web3.darden.virginia.edu/uva-alumni/download/U.Va.%20Entrepreneurial%20Alumni.pdf).

"Universities can be a significant engine for economic growth in their local communities and beyond. They are frequently large employers in their communities and large purchasers of goods and services. They often spend significantly on building and construction. Attracting grants from the federal government and other sources, they spend large amounts on research. This research in turn can lead to intellectual property, such as patents, that is licensed to established companies and entrepreneurial spinouts. Often, this encourage businesses to locate near the origin of that intellectual property. Last, but certainly not least, universities prepare and train students to participate in the workforce.

In this analysis, we focus on this last pathway by which universities help generate economic growth and create jobs. In particular, we examine–based on a survey undertaken in 2013–the entrepreneurial efforts of the alumni of the University of Virginia."
