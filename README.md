## Economic Impact of Entrepreneurial Alumni: A Case Study of University of Virginia

https://web3.darden.virginia.edu/uva-alumni/  

This website shows — through interactive visualization done with [d3.js](https://www.d3js.org) — the findings of a large survey done among the U.Va. alumni. I was also one of the authors of [the report (pdf)] (https://web3.darden.virginia.edu/uva-alumni/download/U.Va.%20Entrepreneurial%20Alumni.pdf) that came out of the survey.

>Survey participants reported creating close to 9,000 ventures. Extrapolating from our survey sample to the population of U.Va. alumni as a whole suggests those numbers may be closer to 65,000 ventures, of which 38,000 are still active, employing 2.3 million people and generating $1.6 trillion in annual worldwide revenues."
