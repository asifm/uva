# Economic Impact of Entrepreneurial Alumni: A Case Study of University of Virginia

http://web3.darden.virginia.edu/uva-alumni/  

I designed this website to share -- through interactive visualization done with d3.js -- the findings of a large survey among U.Va. alumni. I was also the analyst of the survey data and one of the co-authors of the narrative report (http://web3.darden.virginia.edu/uva-alumni/download/U.Va.%20Entrepreneurial%20Alumni.pdf).

"Survey participants reported creating close to 9,000 ventures. Extrapolating from our survey sample to the population of U.Va. alumni as a whole suggests those numbers may be closer to 65,000 ventures, of which 38,000 are still active, employing 2.3 million people and generating $1.6 trillion in annual worldwide revenues."
