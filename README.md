# Economic Impact of Entrepreneurial Alumni: A Case Study of University of Virginia
http://web3.darden.virginia.edu/uva-alumni/
I designed this wedbsite to share the findings -- through interactive visualization -- of a large survey among U.Va. alumni. 

"iversities can be a significant engine for economic growth in their local communities and beyond. They are frequently large employers in their communities and large purchasers of goods and services. They often spend significantly on building and construction. Attracting grants from the federal government and other sources, they spend large amounts on research. This research in turn can lead to intellectual property, such as patents, that is licensed to established companies and entrepreneurial spinouts. Often, this encourage businesses to locate near the origin of that intellectual property. Last, but certainly not least, universities prepare and train students to participate in the workforce.

In this analysis, we focus on this last pathway by which universities help generate economic growth and create jobs. In particular, we examine–based on a survey undertaken in 2013–the entrepreneurial efforts of the alumni of the University of Virginia."
