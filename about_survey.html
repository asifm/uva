  <p>At the beginning of 2013, the University of Virginia had more than 221,000 living alumni spread across the world and throughout North America. In the same year, Michael J. Lenox, Andrew C. King, and Charles E. Eesley developed a survey to take a snapshot of this diverse group’s engagement in entrepreneurial activities.</p>

  <p>An anonymous online survey of 135,227 individuals who graduated from the University of Virginia and had agreed to be contacted by the University elicited 22,757 (16.8%) valid responses. This number represents 10.3 percent of the entire living alumni population of U.Va. The online survey asked respondents for information in three areas: their education and career development, details of their entrepreneurial experience at up to eight ventures, and basic demographics. With help from Asif Mehedi, the authors analyzed the data and estimated the alumni impact through entrepreneurial action.</p>
  <p>This survey was conducted in collaboration with the University of Virginia’s Alumni Association, Center for Survey Research, and was funded by the Batten Institute.</p>
