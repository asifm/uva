<p>All estimates are derivations of the survey data, and no external data (patent filings, high-profile company filings, etc.) were used. </p>
<p>The scaling factors used in the extrapolations hinge on the assumptions that a) the levels of entrepreneurial activity and success are similar between survey respondents and non-respondents, and b) respondents included information about all of their entrepreneurial activities.</p>
<p>The survey did not force responses, and approximately one-third of respondents omitted employment, revenue, and expenditure data. We populated the missing data with the mean of the existing data based on organization type. Afterwards, we applied a scaling factor to these numbers to estimate the full extent of U.Va. alumni entrepreneursâ€™ economic contribution. </p>
<p>Through analysis of the response data, we concluded that a scaling factor of 7.2 is reasonable. We have included aggressive (9.2) and more conservative (5.4) scaled extrapolations that put our estimations in context.</p><p>Our estimates for economic impact are derived from the organizations that respondents indicated were still in operation.</p>
