          <p class="big">We define entrepreneurial alumni as those who found new ventures, who are one of the first five employees of a new venture, who serve on the governing or advisory board of a new venture, or who provide capital to entrepreneurial ventures (e.g., angel investors and venture capitalists). Ventures include for-profit businesses as well as non-profit organizations.</p>

          <p class="first-para">Universities can be a significant engine for economic growth in their local communities and beyond. They are frequently large employers in their communities. They are large purchasers of goods and services. They often spend significantly on building and construction. They spend large amounts on research, attracting grants from the federal government and other sources. This research in turn can lead to intellectual property, such as patents, that is licensed to established companies and entrepreneurial spinouts. In some cases, this may encourage businesses to locate near the origin of that intellectual property. Last, but certainly not least, universities prepare and train students to participate in the workforce.</p>
          <p>In this analysis, we focus on this last pathway by which universities help generate economic growth and create jobs. In particular, we examine–based on <a href="#!" id="show-modal" data-tools="modal" data-width="900" data-title="About the Survey" data-content="about_survey.html">a survey undertaken in 2013</a>–the entrepreneurial efforts of the alumni of the University of Virginia.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Out of the 22,757 respondents to the survey, 6,564 indicated that they were entrepreneurial. These entrepreneurial alumni provided details on 8,979 ventures that they were involved in, suggesting an average of 1.37 ventures per alumni.

          <h3>Regression Analysis</h3>
          <p>A simple multivariate analysis provides insight into the relative sensitivity of entrepreneurial activity to demographic characteristics and experience. We find that females are 32% less likely than their male counterparts to be entrepreneurial while minorities are 61% more likely to be entrepreneurial. Those with business degrees (43%), professional, scientific, or technical work experience (19%), innovation experience (77%), exposure to family entrepreneurs (62%), small business work experience (125%), and those who were involved with U.Va. entrepreneurship programs (87%) are more likely to be entrepreneurial. Interestingly, we find that those with technical degrees (-18%) and doctorate degrees (-26%) are less likely to be entrepreneurial. We find no statistical evidence that out-of-state students or international students are more likely to be entrepreneurial.</p>

          <h3>Age and Entrepreneurship</h3>
          <p>Many alumni pursue entrepreneurship at mid to late stages of their careers. The highest number of entrepreneurs in the survey were born in the mid-1950s suggesting an average age of approximately 60 at the time of the survey. This is despite a massive increase in the number of students and alumni starting in the early 1970s. Of course, entrepreneurial experience is cumulative and therefore will increase with age. However, if we look at the ratio of entrepreneurs to non-entrepreneurs by age, we see an increasing percentage of entrepreneurs as age increases, lending support to the notion that alumni are pursuing entrepreneurship later in their careers.</p>

            <p>An increasing number of ventures have been founded in recent years—the single largest year being 2010.The ventures were distributed across a wide number of industry sectors. 19% classified themselves as professional, scientific or technical services—which could include businesses in information technology and life sciences. Among all the active businesses, 9.9% were pre-revenue, 19.7% were early revenue, 29.9% were in growth phase, and 31.5% indicated that they were mature businesses.</p>

        <blockquote>The survival rate of U.Va. alumni ventures compares favorably to national averages, where approximately half of new firms survive more than five years and less than one-third survive more than ten years.</blockquote>

            <p>This study complements previous studies on Stanford and MIT conducted by Batten Fellow and report coauthor Charles Eesley. The numbers are impressive. As of 2012, Stanford alumni created an estimated 39,900 active firms generating annual worldwide revenues of $2.7 trillion and employing 5.4 million people. A survey in 2003 showed that MIT alumni had founded 25,800 active firms that employed an estimated 3.3 million people and generated annual worldwide revenues of $2 trillion. In both cases, these efforts created substantial local spillovers. 25% of Stanford entrepreneurs founded their companies within 20 miles of the university. 27% of MIT entrepreneurial ventures active in 2003 were headquartered in Massachusetts, creating nearly 1 million jobs. </p>

          <p>This is one of the most comprehensive surveys that we are aware of concerning entrepreneurial alumni at a major public university. U.Va. is ranked among the top 25 universities in the United States and has been ranked the first or second public university since U.S. News began ranking public universities. As a public university, U.Va. receives funding in part from the Commonwealth of Virginia ($154M in 2013 or 5.8% of the university’s total budget). One of the motivations of the state in investing in higher education is to help generate economic growth within the Commonwealth. This report provides evidence of the impact that alumni entrepreneurs have on economic growth and job creation both in the Commonwealth and beyond, and suggests the state is receiving a substantial return on investment from this avenue alone, even ignoring the numerous other ways the University creates value.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Carefully extrapolated, the responses to our survey suggest that entrepreneurially active alumni have created approximately 65,000 companies. These efforts have contributed to the economy—notably, an estimated 2.3 million people have worked at companies founded or directly supported by U.Va. alumni. The organizations that are active today generate estimated global revenues of $1.6 trillion annually.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Of course, these individuals may have started ventures regardless of where, or even if, they received a college education. It is beyond our current analysis to resolve this possibility. However, it is interesting to note that much of the entrepreneurial activity of U.Va. alumni is concentrated within the Commonwealth. Given that the University of Virginia enrolls a sizable number of out-of-state students, the University may be acting as a talent attractor, bringing in high-performing students who are then more likely to remain and start ventures in the Commonwealth. It is further interesting to speculate how many Virginians would leave the state to attend college if they were not admitted to the University of Virginia. Once again, given the tendency for localization of ventures founded by entrepreneurial alumni, this retention may increase the overall number of start-ups within the state. </p>

          <p>This research seeks to uncover one of the many ways that universities generate value for their students, their regional economic ecosystems, and the global business environment. Alumni have launched thousands of firms and created millions of jobs, which is only a fraction of the many ways that university students bring value to the world. Future research focused on understanding which attributes of the university experience help evolve students’ entrepreneurial prowess could provide useful insights for all educational institutions’ ability to cultivate new entrepreneurs.</p>
