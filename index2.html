        <p class="first-para">Universities add value to their local community and broader region in a number of ways. The entrepreneurial efforts of university alumni is an important, yet often ignored, way in which universities help support the creation of jobs and economic growth. In some cases, alumni ventures grow directly out of the laboratories and research at the University and are reflected in reports on university licensing. In most cases, universities have no intellectual property claims on alumni ventures.</p>
        <p>In this report, we analyze the impact of entrepreneurial alumni from the University of Virginia. In our survey, such alumni reported creating close to 9,000 ventures. Extrapolating out to the population of U.Va. alumni suggests those numbers may be closer to 65,000 ventures, of which 38,000 are still active, employing 2.3 million people and generating $1.6 trillion in annual world-wide revenues.</p>
        <p>Within the Commonwealth of Virginia, entrepreneurial alumni reported creating nearly 3,000 ventures that employed over 90,000 people within the state. Extrapolated, Virginia ventures generated revenues of about $395 billion and 371,000 jobs. When one considers the $154 million annual expenditure by the Commonwealth on the University of Virginia, these numbers suggest a substantial return on investment from just entrepreneurial alumni of the University ignoring all other ways the University creates value.</p>
        <p>Of course, these individuals may have started ventures regardless of where, or even if, they received a college education. It is beyond our current analysis to resolve this possibility. However, it is interesting to note that much of the entrepreneurial activity of U.Va. alumni is concentrated within the Commonwealth. Given that the University of Virginia enrolls a sizable number of out-of-state students (27% in 2013), the University may be acting as a talent attractor bringing in high-performing students who are then more likely to remain and start ventures in the Commonwealth. It is further interesting to speculate how many Virginians would leave the state to attend college if they were not admitted to the University of Virginia. Once again, given the tendency for localization of ventures founded by entrepreneurial alumni, this retention may increase the overall number of start-ups within the state.</p>
